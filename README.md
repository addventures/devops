# Addventures: DevOps

The purpose of this project is to provide formal DevOps management for a set of
Drupal instances (platforms) and multisites (apps) owned by an organization.

## Overview

### Host machine support

1. OSX/MAC
2. Windows 10 WSL/Ubuntu 16.04+ on Windows

### Install

Run the below from your host OSX or Windows 10 WSL terminal:

```
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/addventures/devops/bin/install.sh)"
```

This process will:

1. Confirm local host dependencies such as composer.
1. Clone this project to ~/sys/project/devops
1. Run composer install for this project.
1. Symlink an `add` executable file at `/usr/local/bin` to call this project anywhere on local host.
1. Run `add sys:init` command to configure your local environment.

## Environments

### Local

#### Directory structure

The below directory structure is used to maintain your local environment
consistently.

Path | Purpose
--- | ---
~/sys/platform|Each Drupal instance runs out of a single directory here.
~/sys/project|Store git projects that are not Drupal instances, such as this.
~/sys/backup|Database and file backups generated by Drush and other CLI processes.
~/sys/etc|Configuration files used by this project.
~/sys/tmp|Temporary files used by this.

#### Docker/Docksal

Local Drupal environments run in a set of Docker containers managed by Docksal.

Docksal is a wrapper to Docker that abstracts much of its complexity to a
simple interface of developer commands using its `fin` executable.

Docksal provides a set of stack configurations aligned with several cloud
providers, including Acquia. So we use their [Acquia stack configuration](https://docs.docksal.io/stack/zero-configuration/).

In the output below:

1. `cvs-hub_*` containers provide a local instance of CVS Hub running out of: `~/sys/platform/cvs-hub`
1. `cvs-bob_*` containers provide a local instance of CVS Best of Brands running out of: `~/sys/platform/cvs-bob`
1. `docksal-*` containers provide generic management of all instances.

#### Hostnames

Hostname | Purpose
--- | ---
PROJECTNAME.local | Access to Drupal.
mail.PROJECTNAME.local | Mailhog interface that catches outbound e-mails.
solr.PROJECTNAME.local | Solr admin interface.

#### Multi-environment support

Sometimes, it helps to have multiple local environments for the same platform.
This is a common need when working on multiple tracks of work that conflict. So
we provide support for any number of local environments for the same platform.

#### Adding a new platform

1. Run: `add platform:init`
1. Open PR to merge ~/sys/project/devops in to addventures/devops.
